            <h1 class="display-4 text-color bold">What did I do?</h1>
            <p class="lead text-color">At my Achievement House Internship, I performed tasks involving both 3d printing and software development. I had to work with teachers, faculty, IT, and administrators during these tasks, to make sure things were completed properly. For example, I met often with my internship coordinator to discuss ideas and different things that had to get done.</p>

        <div class="jumbotron">
          <h1 class="display-4 text-color bold">3D Printing</h1>
          <p class="lead text-color">I was the main 3D printing technician for the school. This meant I had many student projects to print and finish. Sometimes, this would involve troubleshooting the printer or print files to achieve the best result. In addition, I would help create projects for students in courses involving 3d printing. I also presented to these classes, giving description of a 3d printer and its components, as well as what was required to operate one.</p>

        <div class="jumbotron">
            <h1 class="display-4 text-color bold">Software Development</h1>
            <p class="lead text-color">Often, I had or was approached with ideas of different software that could be developed to help the school. One excellent example of this is the <a href="../projects/attendance-calculator.html">Attendance Calculator</a>. This is a larger project so I reccomend you read about it <a href="../projects/attendance-calculator.html">here</a>.
            Another example is my <a href="../projects/puzzle-cutter.html">Fusion 360 Puzzle Cutter</a>. This was created for a lesson in the "Introduction to Engineering Design" course where students could create and eventually print their own puzzles. This project also introduced a problem where the add-in did not work correctly on school-provided laptops. I had to work with the IT team and use problem solving to find and correct the issue.
            I would often help in programming classes too. This involved sometimes looking at code that isn't working, or creating programs such as this <a href="https://github.com/Bobbyt1500/RPIGamepadControl">Raspberry Pi Robot Gamepad Control</a> script.
